## Who?

Ted Wall, 38 years old. Who I am? Uh, I'm me. Sorry. Best description I have.

Well, second best is probably *neurospicy brainiac*. Late diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, I spent my whole life just pushing myself in any direction that I felt made the most sense to me. It's hard to have clear long term goals, but in some weird way many choices I made along the way has somehow shown themselves to be pretty useful in a completely different setting.

Spending my early teens hyperfocusing on circus acts, juggling, fire performances, theatre, poetry and art? Might as well throw down a hat and call myself a street performer teaching myself early how to rake in money on my abilities.

Spending my late teens hyperfocusing on broken computers, Linux problems, IRC chats with smart people in them, learning how to code websites, getting proficient in Photoshop etc? Accidentally unlocked fast track through Komvux by studying remote, taking all the computer courses in double tempo.

Just two fast examples out of many. I just type this section fast to get rid of the *Hello World* text.

## What?

Well, this is just a personal blog-ish kind of thing where the intent is to have somewhere to throw my thoughts. It's using Astro as framework and GitHub as CMS. 

Since I historically have been a web designer and have worked as much in frontend as in backend, it's a bit out of my comfort zone that the design isn't my own and the things I use isn't built by me ground-up. But, as I have gotten older and, at least in some ways, wiser, I have settled in the thought to let priorities steer my decisions instead of trying to do everything all at once. And priorities right now is getting something up and running where the content is the important part. Design might come later. Or not. Hakuna matata.

## Why?

While writing this I'm enrolled at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola, and a lot of their courses use this solution which inspired me to blatantly steal it all. Since all their courses are in public repos on GitHub, I was able to poke around a bit under the hood of the course sites when I had the time and I really liked what I saw.

It's a nice solution since it allows me to work with markdown files in the terminal and just push changes to update my site. Since I spend more or less all my computer time in the terminal, this is just fantastic.

### But why is everything in monospace?

Because the content is more important than the presentation. Because I like the font. Because this is how I see the world?

Doesn't really matter. I like it. It stays.
