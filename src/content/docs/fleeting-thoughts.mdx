## Purpose

Sometimes I just want to throw something sticky on a wall and see it roll down slowly. This is the place for that.

<div id="hidden-anchor-for-start-of-thoughts" />

cat thought
"
Testing to write a thought from Termux
on my phone. Since I'm using the terminal
everywhere, I can add a thought from
anywhere. Man technology is cool sometimes.
"
```


```sh
date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"

cat thought
"
This thought is written from my terminal
and will automatically be added to the
Fleeting Thought page right below a
hidden anchor I set up for this purpose.
After that it will do a git push and the
webpage will rebuild and add this directly
to the website. Man that's slick. I'll
do a tiny writeup on it.
