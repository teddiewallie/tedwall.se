import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

import deconstructed from '../images/deconstructed.jpg';

## Purpose

Sometimes I just want to throw something sticky on a wall and see it roll down slowly. This is the place for that.

Apparently I made 503 contributions to
repositories on GitHub in December.
Probably not a good measurement for
activity since a contribution could be
anything. Still, 503 times I actively
put care and thought into something
deserves a pat on the head.

Reached the point in university where prior
knowledge won't help me much. I haven't had
a role in my career where databases were
something I had the opportunity to
hyperfocus on, and entity relationship
diagrams are undiscovered territory. Not
only that - the animation course is a bit
draining as well. Oh well, stubbornness
prevails. Back is straight and head is held
high.

Testing to write a thought from Termux
on my phone. Since I'm using the terminal
everywhere, I can add a thought from
anywhere. Man technology is cool sometimes.

This thought is written from my terminal
and will automatically be added to the
Fleeting Thought page right below a
hidden anchor I set up for this purpose.
After that it will do a git push and the
webpage will rebuild and add this directly
to the website. Man that's slick. I'll
do a tiny writeup on it.
