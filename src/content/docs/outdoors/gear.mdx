## Purpose

The times in my life that I have considered the best all have some things in common. I was physically apt, I had momentum, I was active and I was often finding myself in the middle of nature for some reason. This is something I want to reintroduce into my life. Especially when I'm actively downsizing and scaling down pretty much all other things in my life. I am gravitating back to the life where I only own what I use and that I don't own more than I can carry. And in an attempt to get back to that life I'm thinking of documenting my journey. First thing first is overlooking my gear.

I actually have some pretty good basic cheap gear. Problem is, it's very specific. A tiny one man tent that is fantastic for what it is, but it is too small for frequent use. At least for me. I have a pretty big backpack, I'm a pretty big guy and when everything is pretty big, the numbers on things become more of an inaccurate suggestion rather than a guide. I just don't fit the backpack and myself in the tent at once. Same with my sleeping bag. I can't close it. It's too small. Granted, I barely could when I was a bit thinner, but now it's hopeless. So, other gear needed.

Note how I specifically wrote *other* and not *new*. I'll keep my eyes open for used stuff since it's a waste to buy brand new stuff when hiking and camping is one of those hobbies a lot of people try maybe once or twice and then have a bunch of gear they'll never use again. So, look for similar used, but be prepared to buy new if absolutely necessary. Also, no rush or budget to get everything all at once. Baby steps wins the race.

## [ ] Tent

The tent I've set my eyes on is the one I already have, but one size bigger. **The Robens Starlight 2**. I have the **Robens Starlight 1** (not exp) and it's a great tent, so I know what I get when I buy that one.

* 5000mm water column above
* 10000mm below water column below
* 215cm inner length
* 90-115cm inner width

Also high enough to sit straight in.

## [X] Sleeping Bag

If you're a bigger guy, there isn't really a lot of options when it comes to sleeping bags. Custom made ones are super expensive, double ones are excessive and heavy. You take what you can get. Luckily, I think the one I bought actually seems decent. It's by all means not a luxury bag and it isn't meant for winter camping, but still I think I can get some good use out of it. Especially with a good system of sleeping pads. It's the **Urberg Extra Wide Sleeping Bag**.

## [ ] Sleeping Pads

I do already have a very thin no-name self inflating foam pad to use as a bottom layer, but I do want to add another one so that I get some distance to the ground and increase the r value a bit. The Outwell Dreamcatcher Single 7,5cm is both heavy and big, but I think the extra weight is worth it for the extra comfort. R value is set at 6.6, which is crazy good for cold nights. Combined with the lower layer and I don't have to worry even in the coldest nights. Since the tent is tiny there isn't much air to heat up inside the tent and if I am able to insulate the floor, then it won't cool down from below.

## [X] Shoes

I am very picky when it comes to shoes. Definitely an sensory thing related to Autism. Some eight years ago I found the model I've been wearing ever since. It's these boots and some lightweight sneaker style shoes I use in the summer on asphalt, but mostly it's just the boots. Model is called Hanwag Men's Waxenstein Bio Mocca.

## [ ] Pants

As a big guy you don't really get to pick and choose when it comes to clothes. Also, I have two pair of pants I'd love to wear, but they are just a few sizes too small. I'm sure I'll fit into them eventually if I get this outdoors thing up and running. I have yet to decide if I want to buy another pair, since I might not stay this weight for very long. Jeans isn't ideal to hike in, but it beats wasting money at least.

## [ ] Cooking Stuff

This is a tricky one, since it is a lot of different and scattered things. Some I already have, some I still need to get.

### [X] Beredskapsfabriken's Spisa

I actually bought this years ago and used it during my years in the campervan as my main stove. Since it's just plain metal it's quite heavy and nothing you bring when you're hiking far and need to be careful not to bring gear that's too heavy. Still, it's a fantastic piece of equipment that I modified with my own burner and burner cup, so it's a complementary must have for occasions when I don't have to care about the weight that much. Also, it doesn't hurt to have it in a drawer in the kitchen in case of power outage or something.

### [X] Urberg Rogen Power Stove

This I bring anywhere and everywhere, not just on hiking. Perfect little kitchen to cook and heat water in.

### [ ] Tiny Casting Iron Pan

Haven't decided which one yet, but I really want a casting iron frying pan to bring with me that isn't too big and too heavy. Clas Ohlson has one that might work.

### [ ] Primus Mimer Stove

Even though I have the power stove, it isn't really designed for plopping down arbitrary pans on. It's probably modifiable, but I think I'd rather just have another stove for that purpose. It also means I can bring two gas tanks and cook two things at once if I wanted to, like rice in the power stove and egg or meat in the pan. Or, more realistically, move a single gas can between the two.

### [ ] Cooking Pot

Might as well throw in an additional cooking pot in the mix, since I'd rather not cook any sticky stuff in the power stove. It's more for water based stuff like soup and hot water for tea and similar. Doesn't really matter what I buy. Most important part is that it's something I can cook rice in, and that it has both a handle and a lid. Maybe something like this.

### [X] Burner Stove

Bought this to be used in the campervan. I used it a little bit, but not as much as I thought. Still, might have its very specific uses and is also a good backup during a power outage.

### [ ] Food Container

I think I'd benefit from a food container that can keep the food warm for a good while. That way I can cook two meals at once and safely store the second one for later consumption. Doesn't really matter what it is as long as it keeps the food warm for long.
