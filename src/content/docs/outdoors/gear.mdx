## Purpose

The times in my life that I have considered the best all have some things in common. I was physically apt, I had momentum, I was active and I was often finding myself in the middle of nature for some reason. This is something I want to reintroduce into my life, and in an attempt to do that I'm thinking of documenting my journey. First thing first is overlooking my gear.

I actually have some pretty good gear. Problem is, it's very specific. A tiny one man tent that is fantastic for what it is, but it is too small for frequent use. At least for me. I have a pretty big bag, I'm a pretty big guy and when everything is pretty big, the numbers on things become more of an inaccurate suggestion rather than a guide. Same with my sleeping bag. I can't close it. It's too small. Granted, I barely could when I was a bit thinner, but now it's hopeless. So, new gear needed.

## [ ] Tent

The tent I've set my eyes on is the one I already have, but one size bigger. The [Robens Starlight 2](https://www.robens.de/sv-se/shop/outdoor-talt/talt-med-stanger/2-personers-talt/starlight-2-exp). I have the Robens Starlight 1 (not exp) and it's a great tent, so I know what I get when I buy that one.

* 5000mm water column above
* 10000mm below water column below
* 215cm inner length
* 90-115cm inner width

Also high enough to sit straight in.

## [X] Sleeping Bag

If you're a bigger guy, there isn't really a lot of options when it comes to sleeping bags. Custom made ones are super expensive, double ones are excessive and heavy. You take what you can get. Luckily, I think the one I bought actually seems decent. It's by all means not a luxury bag and it isn't meant for winter camping, but still I think I can get some good use out of it. Especially with a good system of sleeping pads.

It's the [Urberg Extra Wide Sleeping Bag](https://www.outnorth.com/se/varumarken/urberg/extra-wide-sleeping-bag-2-0-166593-P391-2308)

## [ ] Sleeping Pads

I do already have a very thing no-name self inflating foam pad to use as a bottom layer, but I do want to add another one so that I get some distance to the ground and increase the r value a bit. The

[Outwell Dreamcatcher Single 7,5cm](https://www.outnorth.com/se/utrustning/bo-sova/liggunderlag/luftmadrasser/uppblasbara-liggunderlag/dreamcatcher-single-7-5-cm-133837-123095-P159-3090) is both heavy and big, but I think the extra weight is worth it for the extra comfort. R value is set at 6.6, which is crazy good for cold nights. Combined with the lower layer and I don't have to worry even in the coldest nights. Since the tent is tiny there isn't much air to heat up inside the tent and if I am able to insulate the floor, then it won't cool down from below.

## [X] Shoes

I am very picky when it comes to shoes. Some eight years ago I found the model I've been wearing ever since. It's these boots and some lightweight sneaker style shoes I use in the summer on asphalt, but mostly it's just the boots. Model is called [Hanwag Men's Waxenstein Bio Mocca](https://www.outnorth.com/se/varumarken/hanwag/men-s-waxenstein-bio-74168-FS350929).

## [ ] Cooking Stuff

This is a tricky one, since it is a lot of different and scattered things. Some I already have, some I still need to get.

### [X] Beredskapsfabriken's Spisa

I actually bought this years ago and used it during my years in the campervan as my main stove. Since it's just plain metal it's quite heavy and nothing you bring when you're hiking far and need to be careful not to bring gear that's too heavy. Still, it's a fantastic piece of equipment that I modified with my own burner and burner cup, so it's a complementary must have for occasions when I don't have to care about the weight that much. Also, it doesn't hurt to have it in a drawer in the kitchen in case of power outage or something.

### [X] Urberg Rogen Power Stove

This I bring anywhere and everywhere, not just on hiking. Perfect little kitchen to cook and heat water in.

### [ ] Tiny Casting Iron Pan

Haven't decided which one yet, but I really want a casting iron frying pan to bring with me that isn't too big and too heavy. Clas Ohlson has one that might work.

### [ ] Primus Mimer Stove

Even though I have the power stove, it isn't really designed for plopping down arbitrary pans on. It's probably modifiable, but I think I'd rather just have another stove for that purpose. It also means I can bring two gas tanks and cook two things at once if I wanted to, like rice in the power stove and egg or meat in the pan. Or, more realistically, move a single gas can between the two.
