## Purpose

The times in my life that I have considered the best all have some things in common. I was physically apt, I had momentum, I was active and I was often finding myself in the middle of nature for some reason. This is something I want to reintroduce into my life, and in an attempt to do that I'm thinking of documenting my journey. First thing first is overlooking my gear.

I actually have some pretty good gear. Problem is, it's very specific. A tiny one man tent that is fantastic for what it is, but it is too small for frequent use. At least for me. I have a pretty big bag, I'm a pretty big guy and when everything is pretty big, the numbers on things become more of an inaccurate suggestion rather than a guide. Same with my sleeping bag. I can't close it. It's too small. Granted, I barely could when I was a bit thinner, but now it's hopeless. So, new gear needed.

## ☐ Tent

The tent I've set my eyes on is the one I already have, but one size bigger. The [Robens Starlight 2](https://www.robens.de/sv-se/shop/outdoor-talt/talt-med-stanger/2-personers-talt/starlight-2-exp). I have the Robens Starlight 1 (not exp) and it's a great tent, so I know what I get when I buy that one.

## ☑  Sleeping Bag

If you're a bigger guy, there isn't really a lot of options when it comes to sleeping bags. Custom made ones are super expensive, double ones are excessive and heavy. You take what you can get. Luckily, I think the one I bought actually seems decent. It's by all means not a luxury bag and it isn't meant for winter camping, but still I think I can get some good use out of it. Especially with a good system of sleeping pads.

It's the [Urberg Extra Wide Sleeping Bag](https://www.outnorth.com/se/varumarken/urberg/extra-wide-sleeping-bag-2-0-166593-P391-2308)

## ☐ Shoes

I am very picky when it comes to shoes. Some eight years ago I found the model I've been wearing ever since. It's these boots and some lightweight sneaker style shoes I use in the summer on asphalt, but mostly it's just the boots. Model is called [Hanwag Men's Waxenstein Bio Mocca](https://www.outnorth.com/se/varumarken/hanwag/men-s-waxenstein-bio-74168-FS350929).
